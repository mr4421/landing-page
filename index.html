								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>I am a rising sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Neuroscience at Barnard College, Columbia University. My interest in these two fields stem from my fascination with AI being used in a laboratory setting for data analysis, to model the brain, and to help predict and diagnose disorders. I officially declare my major(s) in the spring semester of 2025 and in the meantime I have been taking introductory classes for Computer Science, in which I have learned surface level skills in Python for data science and Java programming. I am a beginner programmer with no current personal projects (excluding class projects) and hope to use this website to log my future projects as I continue my learning journey. Stay tuned to follow along!

								<h2>My Experiences [Summer 2024]</h2>
								<p>The summer after my college freshman year is being spent expanding my knowledge on both neuroscience, computer science, and their intersection. I am a research intern at Think Neuro, in which I performed a Bibliometric analysis using the
									 R programming language on relevant research articles from the Web of Science software to better understand the current state of research trends and to identify areas in which further research is needed. I am also a rising Software Engineer
									 Fellow at Headstarter, in which I will be building 5 AI projects in 5 weeks. This experience will be my first exposure to coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and my first dive into how AI works and can be used in my future projects. On campus
									 I am involved in the Women in Computer Science (WICS) club as an event coordinator to help compile internship resources and as the logistics lead organizer for this year’s upcoming hackathon called DivHacks. Apply to Columbia DivHacks
									<a href="https://www.columbiadivhacks.org/">HERE</a>.</p>

								<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
								<p>In my freetime I enjoy reading, journaling, running, crocheting, and baking. In fact, I even started my own
									food content Instagram account in 2022 called @misheemishtees (pictured to the right). One of my reels even ended
									up earning over 50k likes! I hope to one day revive the account and use my new web development skills to 
									make my own food blog website.

								<h2>My Projects</h2>
								<p>Below you can find two projects I did for of my introductory classes. I am a beginner programmer with no current personal projects. I hope to use this section to log my future projects through the Headstarter SWE Fellowship and as I continue my learning journey. Stay tuned to follow along!								</p>

									<h3>Tech Salaries: Master’s vs PhD
									</h3>
									<p>Final project for COMS BC1016 Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Performed A/B testing 
									   using the Python Data Science and NumPy libraries. Analyzed a dataset of people with various technology-related
									   job positions and tested whether there was a significant difference in yearly salaries for each of these jobs for people
									   who hold a Master's degree versus a PhD. <br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dKtt_DKc5kFL_E4lYimnCD_3MpDe7rzDF1y6wWFK5zk/edit?usp=sharing">LINK TO PROJECT</a>.</p>

									<h3>Markov Chains: Gamblers Ruin & Pac-Man</h3>
									<p>Final Project for MATH UN2015 Linear Algebra and Probability using Python. Used markov chains in order to calculate
										the probability of getting from one step to another in k steps in Gambler's Ruin and Pac-Man. Python was used to perform matrix
									 calculations. <br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dCR5KM7lhOfzdsO8T96A4q9oNVaFpjq37gmcMk76l4g/edit?usp=sharing">LINK TO PROJECT</a>.</p>
